- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GM-Fedelopez. I'll try to develope web apps based on <a href="https://www.hattrick.org/">Hattrick</a>. 
Like games or rankings obtaining data directly by CHPP, using <a href="https://github.com/jetwitaussi/PHT">PHT</a>.

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in develope what ever users like to use. So, if you play any game in HT Forums, or Federation, based on Hattrick Players/Matches/Teams... or you just want to create any study, and need then collect special kind of data form Hattrick Matches then just ask.

- ğŸ“« How to reach me ... send me and HT-Mail in Hattrick
